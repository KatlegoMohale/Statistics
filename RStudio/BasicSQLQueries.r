# Question 2
# Consider the Orion database. Create a report that includes each employeeâ€™s age at time of employment. 
# The report should contain the columns Employee_ID, Birth_Date, Employee_Hire_Date and Age. Name it q2.

# Question 3
# Consider the Orion database. Using data contained in the customer table, create a report with the name q3, that shows the following statistics for each country:
# a) total number of customers
# b) total number of male customers
# c) total number of female customers
# d) Arrange the report by total number of customers so that the country with the highest value is listed first, with the remaining countries following in descending order.

# Question 4
# Consider the Orion database. Use the customer table to determine the number of Orion customers of each gender in each country. Display columns named Country, 
# Male Customers, and Female Customers. Display only those countries that have more female customers than male customers. Order the report by descending female 
# customers. Name it q4.

# Question 5
# Consider the Musico databse. The marketing division at Musico would like a list of customers who reside in either Johannesburg or Pretoria and whose email address is
